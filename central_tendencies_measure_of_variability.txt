Central Tendencies are the central values in the dataset. It tells us where the center of data lies.

Mean : The average sum.

 Example:  (100 + 110 + 120 + 500) / 4 = 207.5.

 when to use in ML ?  Feature scaling, imputation



Median : The middle value. If numbers are odd in count ,

  Arrange in ascending and the middle most value , If numbers are even , Arrange in ascending sum of middle two values / 2

  Example: a = [100 + 110 + 120 + 500] , Median of a is  (110+120) / 2  =  115

  when to use in ML ? Better for skewed data or outliers



Mode :  Frequent Value in the data set

    Example : [15,17,19,17,35,91,17,85]

    The Mode is 17

    When to use in ML? In categorical feature analysis


Variability : How Spread out the data is from the center

Main Measures : Range , variance , Standard deviation

Data = [5, 7, 8, 6, 9, 10, 12, 8, 6, 7]

Mean Average  =  Sum of all / Number of values  =  5+7+8+6+9+10+12+8+6+7 /  10  = 78/10 = 7.8

Range = [5,6,7,8,9,10,12] = 12 - 5  = 7

Variance : average of the squared distances from the Mean

Why square to avoid negative values

(5 - 7.8)^2 = 7.84
(7 - 7.8)^2 = 0.64
(8 - 7.8)^2 = 0.04
(6 - 7.8)^2 = 3.24
(9 - 7.8)^2 = 1.44
(10 - 7.8)^2 = 4.84
(12 - 7.8)^2 = 17.64
(8 - 7.8)^2 = 0.04
(6 - 7.8)^2 = 3.24
(7 - 7.8)^2 = 0.64

Now, Sum =7.84+0.64+0.04+3.24+1.44+4.84+17.64+0.04+3.24+0.64= 39.6

Variance = 39.6 /10 = 3.96

Standard deviation : Square Root of variance

Root of 3.96 = 1.99

Wondering why do we need Variability in the ML lets understand with an example.

Imagine:
You and your 9 friends all baked cupcakes.
Each person made a different number of cupcakes of sizes [5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

Now you want to understand: “How much did we all make, and how different are our numbers?”

This is exactly what machine learning tries to understand too — how spread out or tight numbers are in data.

Range tells us How far apart is the best and worst?

 12 -5 = 7

Variance tells us How much does everyone’s cupcake count vary from the average.

First, find the mean (average).

Then, for each person, check:

"How far is this person from the average?"  Square that number why square ? (to avoid negatives).

Finally average those , This tells us how spread out the values are whether little or more.

On average, the squared difference from the mean is 4.76 cupcake².
It's a measure of spread, but in squared units, not actual cupcakes.

Standard Deviation:

On average, how far is each person from the middle

The actual average distance from the mean is about 2.18 cupcakes.

Normal distribution and skewness

Normal distribution means data points in the data set lie in the middle of the range and rest tapper off symmetrically to the either extreme

Normal distribution is also called as Gaussian distribution

Skewness means when distribution curve appears distorted or skewed either to the left or right in a statistical distribution

Negatively skewed means  Tapper or slant in the left side

Positively skewed means Tapper or slant in the right side

Poisson Distribution is a probability distribution that measures how many times an event is likely to occur with in a specific period of time.

With help of Poisson distribution we can understand the independent events that occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.

p(x)= e^-λ λ^x / x! where , λ is the mean , x is number of times event occurs , e is euler's number - 2.718
